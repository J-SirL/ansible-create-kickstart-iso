# Generating Encrypted Password for Kickstart File in Linux

## Overview
This document provides instructions on how to generate an encrypted password for use in a kickstart file for Linux installations.

## Prerequisites
- Access to a Linux terminal.
- OpenSSL installed on your system.

## Instructions

### 1. Open the Terminal
Launch your command-line interface.

### 2. Generate the Encrypted Password
Use the `openssl passwd` command. For better security, SHA-512 is recommended.

```bash
openssl passwd -6
```

After entering this command, you'll be prompted to enter the password you wish to encrypt.

### 3. Using the Encrypted Password in Your Kickstart File
Include the encrypted password in your kickstart file in the section where you set the root password:

```plaintext
rootpw --iscrypted [your-encrypted-password]
```

Replace `[your-encrypted-password]` with the password generated by the `openssl` command.
